# Assessor_WebSiteSSIS
This is being created as a recovery of Assessor_ODS2 solution.  Additional information will be added as the solution builds.

Database Projects were deleted because there are many cross database references that make it too difficult to deploy as a db project.  These end up showing 400+ errors when trying to build the projects.  Database scripts are being used instead.  Versions of the production databases were taken (10/24) as create db scripts and saved in the database scripts folder to use going forward.
